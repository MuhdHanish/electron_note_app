## Markdown Magic ✍️

Transform your plain text into beautifully formatted notes using these Markdown features:

### Text Styling

Make your text stand out with these formatting options:

- Make it **bold** by wrapping text in double asterisks: `**bold**`
- Add _emphasis_ with underscores: `_emphasis_`
- Combine them for **_bold italic_** text: `**_bold italic_**`

### Headings 📚

Organize your thoughts with different heading levels:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

Create headings by using hash symbols: `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.

### Lists 📝

#### Bullet Points

- Break down complex ideas

Use a hyphen and space `- ` to create bullet points.

### Quotes & Code 💭
